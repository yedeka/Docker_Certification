Installing Docker on Ububtu 
1] Update packages 
sudo apt-get update

2] Install reprequsite helper packages. -y allows us to say yes to all the prompts.
sudo apt-get -y install  apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common

3] download the GPG key for the docker repo 
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
Command before | downloads the docker GPG key and command after | adds the GPG key. 
GPG key is used to verify the docker repositories.  

4] Command to add docker repository 
sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"

5] Refresh package list 
sudo apt-get update

6] Install docker packages i.e. docker-ce, docker-ce-cli and containerd.io

7] Verify docker by checking the docker version. 
sudo docker version 

8] Give access to user cloud_user without sudo. This can be done by adding user cloud_user to the docker group. Unless this
is done when docker version is run we only get the clinet information and the server information is not provided due to 
no access exception. Hence we need to add the user cloud_user to docker group via below mentioned commands 
sudo usermod -a -G docker cloud_user
After usermod command is run in order for the command to take effect the server needs to be restarted. 
run the docker version command after usermod and we can see the server version as well. 

9] Set default logging driver to syslog. 
In order to do this we need to edit a file /etc/docker/daemon.json 
We need to do this as root. 
sudo vi /etc/docker/daemon.json
After the config change docker needs to be restarted for the change to take effect. This can be verified by running docker 
info.
Hence restart docker by running 
sudo systemctl restart docker 
Doing docker info after change allows us to see the change being reflected.
