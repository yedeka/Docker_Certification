Namespaces - 
Groups that allow you to isolate process in terms of resources that the processes can see. 
Namespaces prevent processess from interferring with each other.
Docker uses namespaces to isolate containers so that contsiners can operate independently and securely. 

Namespaces used - 
pid - Used for process isolation. 
net -  Used for containers network connections. 
ipc - Used for interprocess communication. 
mnt - used for filesystem mount points. 
uts - kernal and version identifiers. Different containers running different kernals. 
The above namespaces are used automatically by docker, we do not need to explicitely set these namespaces up. 

Special namespace -  user allows a container processed to run as root inside the container mapping to an unpriviledged user on host. Very important for security 
so that a compromised container does not comprise the entire host. 

Control Groups (cgroups)
Limits applications to a sepcific set of resources. Sounds simillar like namespaces but they are still different. 
However namespaces limit a process transparently about resources to a process without the process being aware of even the existence of the process. However cgroups 
are more about limiting resource usage. So namespaces limit what resource a process can see but control groups limit what resources a process can use. Hence control 
groups pertain to specify enforcing limits on resources.
