Docker does not officially support image flattening since that is against docker philisophy. However this can be done as follows 
Step 1] Run a container from an image. 
Step 2] Export the container into an archive using docker export. 
Step 3] Import the archive as a new image using docker import. 

Steps for doing this 
1] Create a Dockerfile as follows 
FROM alpine:3.9.3
RUN echo "Hello, world!" > message.txt
CMD cat message.txt

2] build the image as 
docker build -t nonflat .

3] Now run a container from nonflat image 
docker run -d --name flat_container nonflat

4] Now export the running container 
docker export flat_container > flat.tar

5] Now import the tar as new image. This can be done by doing a cat on file and piping that data to docker import as follows 
cat flat.tar | docker import - flat:latest
The size of the image remains the same however we only get one layer in the resulting image
Checking for the history of flat we get only one layer but the size remains the same.
