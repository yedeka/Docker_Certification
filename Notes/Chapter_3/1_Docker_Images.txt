Docker image - Docker image is a file containing code and components needed to run software in a container. 
Layered file system - Used for building the images. Images are made up of layers. 
Each layer only contains the differences from previous layer. 
Each layer is not a full copy. 

For e.g. 
a standard image for running a python web app might look like 
1] Base image - ubuntu 
2] Python - All files and executables needed for running python. 
3] Web application - Python web app code files and web server environment. 

THese 3 layers form an image but the only drawback is these layers are not writable meaning they can't be chnaged. Hence
we run a container to create an additional writable layer on top of the image layers. 

Why layered file system 
Advantages - 
1] Smaller overall storage footprint - FOr e.g. of we want to run 5 nginx containers on a machine then we would not need 
5 images, we can just work with 1 image and 5 writable container layers. 
We can not only share layers between containers but we can also share layers between images. 
This sharing of layers between containers and images results in smaller overall storage footprint. 
2] Faster image transfer - Due to less storage data. Proven by the fact that if an image is already there on a host second
docker run does not end up downloading the image again. 
3] Faster image build - Build only the changed layer and upper layers for building a new image. 

Pulling an image from remote 
1] docker image pull <Image_Name> for e.g. docker image pull nginx 
2] docker image history <Image_Name> for e.g. docker image history nginx. List all the layers used for building the image.
