Common commands for managing images on the system 
1] docker image pull nginx:1.14.0 - Pulls image from docker hub if it does not exist on host. 
synonymous to docker pull nginx:1.14.0

2] docker image ls - Lists currently existing images. 
docker image ls -a - Lists all of the images including intermediate images. 

3] docker image inspect <Image_TAG> - Allows us to have a look at all the image metadata.
We can use a go template to format only specific fields for the image metadata 
i.e. docker image inspect <Image_TAG> --format {{.Architecture}} provides only Architecutre field of image metadata.

4] Removing an image from host 
docker image rm <TAG_NAME> for e.g. docker image rm nginx:1.14.0 
docker rmi <TAG_NAME> docker rmi nginx:1.14.0

5] If a container is running an image then it can not be deleted. However we can force remove an image even if a container is running with force tag -f
docker image rm -f nginx:1.14.0
If the iamge files are currently being used then -f will not delete the files but it will just delete the tag. i.e. It generates a dangling image which is not referred
to by any tag or container. 

6] To delete images that are not being referenced by any tags or containers we can use following command 
docker image prune.
